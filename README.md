This project contains the core logic for Agent Shutton, a multi-agent system designed to assist users in creating various types of blog posts. The agent is built using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and follows a modular architecture.

Architecture

Problem Statement
Writing blogs manually is laborious because it requires significant time investment in research, drafting, editing, and formatting each piece of content from scratch. The repetitive nature of structuring posts and maintaining consistent tone across multiple articles can quickly become mentally exhausting and drain creative energy. Manual blog writing also struggles to scale when content demands increase, forcing writers to choose between quality and quantity or invest in hiring additional staff. Automation can streamline research gathering, generate initial drafts, handle formatting consistency, and maintain publishing schedules, allowing human writers to focus their expertise on strategic direction, creative refinement, and adding unique insights that truly require human judgment.

Solution Statement
Agents can automatically research topics by gathering information from multiple sources, synthesizing key insights, and identifying trending themes relevant to your target audience. They can generate initial draft outlines or full articles based on specific parameters like tone, length, significantly reducing the time spent on the blank page problem. Additionally, agents can manage the entire publishing workflow by scheduling posts, distributing content across multiple platforms, monitoring performance metrics, and even suggesting improvements based on engagement data—transforming blog management from a manual chore into a streamlined, data-driven process.

Architecture
Core to Agent Shutton is the blogger_agent -- a prime example of a multi-agent system. It's not a monolithic application but an ecosystem of specialized agents, each contributing to a different stage of the blog creation process. This modular approach, facilitated by Google's Agent Development Kit, allows for a sophisticated and robust workflow. The central orchestrator of this system is the interactive_blogger_agent.

Architecture

The interactive_blogger_agent is constructed using the Agent class from the Google ADK. Its definition highlights several key parameters: the name, the model it uses for its reasoning capabilities, and a detailed description and instruction set that governs its behavior. Crucially, it also defines the sub_agents it can delegate tasks to and the tools it has at its disposal.

The real power of the blogger_agent lies in its team of specialized sub-agents, each an expert in its domain.

Content Strategist: robust_blog_planner

This agent is responsible for creating a well-structured and comprehensive outline for the blog post. If a codebase is provided, it will intelligently incorporate sections for code snippets and technical deep dives. To ensure high-quality output, it's implemented as a LoopAgent, a pattern that allows for retries and validation. The OutlineValidationChecker ensures that the generated outline meets predefined quality standards.

Technical Writer: robust_blog_writer

Once the outline is approved, the robust_blog_writer takes over. This agent is an expert technical writer, capable of crafting in-depth and engaging articles for a sophisticated audience. It uses the approved outline and codebase summary to generate the blog post, with a strong emphasis on detailed explanations and illustrative code snippets. Like the planner, it's a LoopAgent that uses a BlogPostValidationChecker to ensure the quality of the written content.

Editor: blog_editor

The blog_editor is a professional technical editor that revises the blog post based on user feedback. This allows for an iterative and collaborative writing process, ensuring the final article meets the user's expectations.

Social Media Marketer: social_media_writer

To maximize the reach of the created content, the social_media_writer generates promotional posts for platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. This agent is an expert in social media marketing, crafting engaging and platform-appropriate content to drive traffic to the blog post.

Essential Tools and Utilities
The blogger_agent and its sub-agents are equipped with a variety of tools to perform their tasks effectively.

File Saving (save_blog_post_to_file)

A simple yet essential tool that allows the interactive_blogger_agent to export the final blog post to a Markdown file.

Codebase Analysis (analyze_codebase)

This tool is crucial for generating technically accurate and relevant content. It ingests a directory, traverses its files using glob and os, and creates a consolidated codebase_context. It even handles potential UnicodeDecodeError exceptions by attempting to read files with a different encoding, ensuring robustness.

Validation Checkers (OutlineValidationChecker, BlogPostValidationChecker)

These custom BaseAgent implementations are a key part of the system's robustness. They check for the presence and validity of the blog outline and post, respectively. If the validation fails, they do nothing, causing the LoopAgent to retry. If the validation succeeds, they escalate with EventActions(escalate=True), which signals to the LoopAgent that it can proceed. This is a powerful mechanism for ensuring quality and controlling the flow of execution in a multi-agent system.

Conclusion
The beauty of the blogger_agent lies in its iterative and collaborative workflow. The interactive_blogger_agent acts as a project manager, coordinating the efforts of its specialized team. It delegates tasks, gathers user feedback, and ensures that each stage of the content creation process is completed successfully. This multi-agent coordination, powered by the Google ADK, results in a system that is modular, reusable, and scalable.

The blogger_agent is a compelling demonstration of how multi-agent systems, built with powerful frameworks like Google's Agent Development Kit, can tackle complex, real-world problems. By breaking down the process of technical content creation into a series of manageable tasks and assigning them to specialized agents, it creates a workflow that is both efficient and robust.

Value Statement
Agent Shutton reduced my blog development time by 6-8 hours per week, enabling me to produce more content at higher quality. I have also been producing blogs across new domains - as the agent drives research that I'd otherwise not be able to do given time constraints and subject matter expertise.

If I had more time I would add an additional agent to scan various sites for trending topics and use that research to inform my blog topics. This would require integrating applicable MCP servers or building custom tools.

Installation

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

blogger_agent/: The main Python package for the agent.
agent.py: Defines the main interactive_blogger_agent and orchestrates the sub-agents.
sub_agents/: Contains the individual sub-agents, each responsible for a specific task.
blog_planner.py: Generates the blog post outline.
blog_writer.py: Writes the blog post.
blog_editor.py: Edits the blog post based on user feedback.
social_media_writer.py: Generates social media posts.
tools.py: Defines the custom tools used by the agents.
config.py: Contains the configuration for the agents, such as the models to use.
eval/: Contains the evaluation framework for the agent.
tests/: Contains integration tests for the agent.
Workflow
The interactive_blogger_agent follows this workflow:

Analyze Codebase (Optional): If the user provides a directory, the agent analyzes the codebase to understand its structure and content.
Plan: The agent delegates the task of generating a blog post outline to the robust_blog_planner.
Refine: The user can provide feedback to refine the outline. The agent continues to refine the outline until it is approved by the user.
Visuals: The agent asks the user to choose their preferred method for including visual content.
Write: Once the user approves the outline, the agent delegates the task of writing the blog post to the robust_blog_writer.
Edit: After the first draft is written, the agent presents it to the user and asks for feedback. The blog_editor revises the blog post based on the feedback. This process is repeated until the user is satisfied with the result.
Social Media: After the user approves the blog post, the agent asks if they want to generate social media posts. If the user agrees, the social_media_writer is used.
Export: When the user approves the final version, the agent asks for a filename and saves the blog post as a markdown file using the save_blog_post_to_file tool.
